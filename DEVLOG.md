My YouTube videos are pretty dry and rather than source music from people that know how to make music (copyright free), I'll make my own. At the same time learning Go (it's easier than Rust).

Watching this video for ideas

I'm tired, didn't make much progress, didn't get far in that video

So far I don't really have a vision yet, I see like soundboard designs in my mind

Teenage Engineering is cool regarding hardware designs

This will be a desktop GUI app though because I want to work with that

idk I haven't worked on a project in a bit mostly dealing with being broke

trying to freelance but I haven't succeeded in that (landed a paying gig) though I have dumped days of time into potential contracts
